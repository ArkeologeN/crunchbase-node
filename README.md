crunchbase-node
===============
Wrapper on top of Crunchbase REST API in Node.js

## Getting Started

Wrapper can be downloaded from npm:

`npm install node-crunchbase --save`

Once installed, its easy to use it:

```javascript
var crunchbase = require('node-crunchbase')('app_key_id_here');
```

I'm in hurry! Please look at `spec/test_spec.js` in order to understand the usage.
